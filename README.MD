### GOAL
    Aiming to build a mixed model for foreign currency trading strategies

### Things to do
    0. Data preprocess, and find out which pairs to target at
    1. Traditional trading strategies and Implementation
    2. rnn in foreign currency prediction 
        (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919302066)
    3. CNN in foreign currency prediction

### Preprocess data and find out paris

    1. 3 major trading time/locations -> pairs
    2. Further understanding of dataset from CITI bank.
    3. NEED MORE CONTEXT ON FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
    
### Traditional strategies
    1. MACD (移动平均线线交易)

### CNN in foreign currency prediction
    Research in progroess. Should be able to find ideas from RNN's paper
    
    CNN in time series:

### Rooad Map Overview
    1. Find a mixed profittable model
    2. potential to grow into A to A or even B to B platform
